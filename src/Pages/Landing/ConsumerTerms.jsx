                                Our websites and mobile applications allow you to buy and send our reloadable SOMTINSOMTIN voucher (“SOMTINSOMTIN voucher”). The SOMTINSOMTIN voucher may be initially loaded in variable amounts with specified increments but no more than GHS 2,000 per voucher and is only valid for the purchase by you (or the recipient of your SOMTINSOMTIN voucher) of Vendor gift vouchers via the SOMTINSOMTIN websites or mobile applications. SOMTINSOMTIN vouchers can NOT be used in retail stores. If you purchase multiple SOMTINSOMTIN vouchers on a single day, the total/aggregate amount that you load on all the vouchers should not exceed GHS 10,000 in a single day. SOMTINSOMTIN vouchers have no fees and will never expire; however, based upon the laws in the applicable state, if you (or the recipient of your SOMTINSOMTIN voucher) do not use the SOMTINSOMTIN voucher your funds may be escheated to such applicable state. SOMTINSOMTIN vouchers are not redeemable for cash and no refunds or exchanges will be provided for SOMTINSOMTIN vouchers (except as required by law).

                                We offer a variety of gift vouchers and gift codes (collectively, “Gift vouchers”) for purchase via our websites or mobile applications. SOMTINSOMTIN accepts various forms of payment, including by debit card (each, a “Payment card”), Mobile Money, Apple Pay, Google Wallet. In addition, Gift vouchers can be purchased with a virtual SOMTINSOMTIN voucher (described in Section 1.1 above). All Gift vouchers are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or any part of an order and to discontinue products without notice, even if you have already placed your order. The total/aggregate amount that you may load on one or multiple Gift vouchers in a single day should not exceed GHS 10,000. All prices are subject to change without notice and the price charged to you will be the price displayed at the time you place your order. After purchasing a Gift voucher, these Terms will no longer apply and you (or the recipient of the Gift voucher) must activate the Gift voucher by following the instructions provided by the Vendor, defined below. The Gift voucher will only function upon such activation. Activated Gift vouchers may be available within seconds; however, additional time may be required for certain activations. If your Gift voucher has not been activated within 30 seconds, please contact us at support@SOMTINSOMTIN.com.
