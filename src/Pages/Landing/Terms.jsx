You may earn Points by taking certain actions when you interact with SOMTINSOMTIN or authorized third parties. Points Balance. Each time you earn Points, we will update your Points balance, which you can view by logging into your online account.

                                The Points you earn may be applied toward future gift VOUCHER purchases, provided that Points may be redeemed only for the purchase of eligible gift VOUCHERs. Your Points and your SOMTINSOMTIN VOUCHER Balance may not be used together to make a gift VOUCHER purchase. Eligible gift VOUCHERs may change over time. Please click here for information about how Points may be applied toward purchases. Restrictions. Points cannot be purchased, resold, transferred, redeemed for cash or applied to any other account. We may limit the number of Points you can earn or use within certain periods of time or implement other restrictions on the receipt or use of Points.

Unless we expressly state in writing otherwise, Points automatically expire at the end of the calendar year following the year in which such Points were earned or received (for example, Points earned in June 2014 will expire on December 31, 2015). Termination. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your participation in the SOMTINSOMTIN Points program, and your access to the Points in your account, if you violate these Terms. We may also suspend, cancel or otherwise limit your access to Points if we suspect fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity associated with your account. If we determine you fraudulently obtained Points or used fraudulently-obtained Points, we may revoke those Points and suspend or terminate your account.
